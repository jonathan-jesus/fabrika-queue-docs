## Detailed Milestones

### Beta Phase

Focused on feature validation, usability testing, and incorporating user feedback to shape the product.

### Remote services

Development and testing of remote monitoring and remote control capabilities.

### Stable release

Final stabilization and polishing in preparation for the v1.0 release, marking the end of the Beta phase.

### Long Term / Research

Features under exploration that do not yet have a committed timeline.

- **MacOS**: The project is already structured to support this platform, but I currently lack the resources to build and test it.
- **Mobile app for remote features**: A nice-to-have addition that will depend on overall project adoption and community support.
