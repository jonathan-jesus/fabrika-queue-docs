## Key Features

*   **Multi-File Queuing**: Add multiple Blender (`.blend`) files to a centralized queue.
*   **Task Management**: Define specific render tasks for each file (e.g., render specific frames, change output format).
*   **Background Rendering**: Process renders in the background using Blender's command-line interface, keeping your UI responsive.
*   **Log Monitoring**: View real-time logs for each render task to track progress and catch errors.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (requires Blender installed).
